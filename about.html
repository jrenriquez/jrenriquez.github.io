            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Golub Capital Social Impact Lab (Stanford Graduate School of Business) and the Digital Economy Lab (Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence), where I collaborate with Professors Susan Athey and Erik Brynjolfsson. My current projects explore ways to decrease misinformation sharing and harness generative AI to enhance deliberation on social issues, as well as to augment human survey responses.</p>

            <p>My research is situated in the political economy of economic and political development, with a focus on political accountability and elite behavior. Key areas of my work include the role of (mis)information in improving political accountability and reducing polarization, the causes and effects of criminal-political violence on democratic representation, and the effects of the lack of coordination across levels of government.</p>

            <p>I earned my Ph.D. in Political Economy and Government (PEG) from the Harvard Kennedy School and the Economics and Government Departments at Harvard University in May 2023.</p>

            <p>Originally from Durango, Mexico, I received a B.A. in Economics and a B.A. in Political Science from Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México (ITAM) in Mexico City.</p>
