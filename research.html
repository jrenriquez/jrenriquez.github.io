                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> While social media has facilitated protests and challenged democratic norms, online information campaigns could also enhance electoral accountability. High saturation campaigns—that target many voters—may ignite social effects beyond direct exposure. We experimentally evaluate the electoral impact of non-partisan Facebook ads in Mexico. Vote shares of municipal incumbent parties that engaged in zero/negligible expenditure irregularities increased by 6-7 percentage points in directly-targeted electoral precincts and 3 percentage points in untargeted precincts within treated municipalities. Both effects were greater where ads targeted 80%—rather than 20%—of the electorate. The amplifying effects of high saturation campaigns reflect interactions between citizens within more socially-connected municipalities.</p>

                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Political polarization can negatively impact electoral accountability by influencing how citizens perceive and process incumbent performance information. We study how such information affects voting behavior in a polarized environment, and how this varies when additionally treating citizens with a debiasing nudge to incorporate counter-attitudinal information.</p>

                <p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Criminal organizations exert political influence through bribery, voter mobilization, and pre- and post-electoral violence. We present a model in which organized crime groups strategically choose between inducements (e.g., vote buying), punishments (e.g., violence against voters and/or candidates), or a combination of both to obtain political favors, either before or after elections. The model elucidates the mechanisms through which these choices impact voter turnout and electoral competitiveness—two critical aspects of democratic processes. We derive direct, testable empirical implications and discuss their relevance to existing and prospective research, offering insights for transparency-enhancing policies.</p>

                <p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Developing public policies that effectively address complex societal issues while representing diverse perspectives remains a significant challenge in governance and policy-making. This paper presents \textbf{Policy Dreamer}, an evolutionary dynamics-based preference aggregation method designed to create public policy that aligns with heterogeneous populations while preserving solution diversity. It does so in three stages: a) Initial Public Policy Generation (where public policies are defined as a set of goals, actions, and strategies aimed at addressing a specific societal issue), b) Preference Elicitation from a constituency of humans, and c) Policy Refinement using simulated human feedback. We apply this approach to the domain of creating public policy, which require navigating complex socioeconomic trade-offs. To validate our method, we measure our system's ability to create \textit{popular yet diverse policy proposals} in the following domains: Healthcare, Gun Control, and Social Media regulation. Our approach iteratively \textit{aligns policies} with respect to a base constituency, while using evolutionary search to ensure that policy diversity is not compromised. When compared to an expert-crafted set of policies, it can \textit{generate} up to 25\% novel policies. However, it exhibits limitations in capturing the full diversity of these expert-crafted policies, particularly in controversial or emerging policy domains. Overall, our preliminary results suggest that Large Language Models (LLMs) are able to actively elicit preferences from a constituency of people, and iteratively generate statements (public policies) that align with this constituency while preventing a collapse in statement diversity.</p>
